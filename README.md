> **This is an automated system that parses XML-based wafer measurement data and performs precise analysis of IL, ER, VpiL, and Phase Shift to generate visualizations and integrated Excel reports.**

This project is an end-to-end pipeline that automatically analyzes wafer-level test data from optical devices such as Mach-Zehnder Modulators and outputs the results as a dashboard-style report for at-a-glance visualization.

# 2. Project information
### 📖 About This Project

Our goal is to build a system that automatically analyzes
optical characteristics using Python and XML data.

The system receives raw wafer data from the customer along
with specific analysis requests, including:

- Target Wafer
- Die Row & Column
- Analysis Options

Based on these inputs, the pipeline acts as a **black box** —
automatically processing the requested data and delivering
the final results without manual intervention.


### ▶️ How It Works

1. Extract files named `HY202103` from the customer-provided dataset
2. Process raw XML data through a series of analysis modules
3. Export the final results as `.csv` and `.xlsx` reports

# 7. ⚙️ Data Analysis Pipeline

When `run.py` is executed, a total of 9 core modules operate 
sequentially to process the data.

### 1. Data Extraction & Visualization Preparation

- **`data_parser.py`** (Data Parsing)
  - Loads target band (LMZC, LMZO) spectrum data required 
    for analysis from the raw XML data files.
- **`plot.py`** (Raw Data Plot)
  - Generates basic wavelength-transmission spectrum plots 
    based on the parsed raw data.

### 2. Signal Correction & Target Region Extraction

- **`flatting.py`** (Signal Flattening)
  - Corrects offset errors between the Reference device and 
    MZM device to flatten the signal baseline.
- **`zoom.py`** (Target Wavelength Zoom-in)
  - Zooms into key analysis wavelength ranges according to 
    each band's characteristics. 
    (LMZC: 1550 nm / LMZO: 1310 nm)
- **`Fitting.py`** (Noise Filtering & Fitting)
  - Removes high-frequency noise such as ripple from the 
    measured signal and applies polynomial fitting to 
    smooth and refine the data.

### 3. Device Performance Metric Calculation

- **`Phase shift - V.py`** (Phase Shift Calculation)
  - Tracks how much the wavelength shifts according to the 
    applied bias voltage based on the dip positions in the 
    fitted graph, and calculates the phase shift.
- **`VpiL.py`** (VπL Extraction)
  - Converts the bias-dependent phase shift into half-wave 
    voltage (Vπ) and multiplies by the device length (L) to 
    calculate the final electro-optic modulation efficiency 
    index, VπL.

### 4. Wafer Map & Box Graph Auto-Generation

- **`ER_Analysis.py`** (Wafer Map & Box Graph)
  - Generates `Wafer Map` and `Box Graph` files from the 
    extracted ER data.
- **`IL_Analysis.py`** (Wafer Map & Box Graph)
  - Generates `Wafer Map` and `Box Graph` files from the 
    extracted IL data.
- **`VpiL_Analysis.py`** (Wafer Map & Box Graph)
  - Generates `Wafer Map` and `Box Graph` files from the 
    extracted VpiL data.

### 5. Visualization Merging & Report Auto-Generation

- **`combine_plot.py`** (Dashboard Image Merging)
  - Merges multiple graphs generated throughout the analysis 
    into a single summary dashboard image, grouped by 
    wafer and measurement date.
- **`export_summary.py`** (Consolidated Report Export)
  - Saves the extracted key metric data (IL, ER, VπL) as 
    `.csv` and `.xlsx` files. The Excel file includes 
    hyperlinks mapped to merged summary images (PNG), 
    enabling intuitive one-click data verification.
